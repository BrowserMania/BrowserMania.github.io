## Problem
 
Web-based threats, including phishing attacks and malware, are constantly evolving, putting users' devices at risk when browsing the internet. The challenge is to provide a solution that isolates browsing activities, preventing malicious content from reaching user devices, while maintaining a fluid user experience.

## Objectif

- Enhanced Security: Isolate web browsing sessions to protect users from malicious content.
- Scalability and Efficiency: Use Kubernetes to manage and scale multiple sandboxed browser instances efficiently.
- Seamless User Experience: Ensure smooth browsing by streaming the browser display to the user's desktop using WebRTC.
- Prevent Threats: Ensure that threats like malware are contained within isolated environments, never reaching the user’s device.

## Features

-    Browser Replacement: This project is not designed to replace traditional browsers but to offer an additional security layer.
-   Antivirus Alternative: BrowserMania is not intended to replace antivirus software but to complement existing security solutions.
-    High-Resource Media Streaming: The focus is on secure web browsing, not on intensive media streaming or gaming.

## Solutions

BrowserMania leverages Kubernetes to create and manage sandboxed browser environments. Each browser instance runs in a secure, isolated container, protecting the user's device from harmful content. The browser's display is streamed in real time using WebRTC, providing a responsive and secure user experience.

## Future-Features

- Kubernetes Orchestration: Scalable management of multiple isolated browser instances.
- WebRTC Integration: Streams browser sessions to the user’s local browser in real-time.
- Enhanced Security: Ensures that malicious content is contained and does not affect the user’s device.
